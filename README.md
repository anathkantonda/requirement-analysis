# What is Requirement Analysis?

<p>Requirement Analysis is the critical process in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves defining, documenting, and validating the expectations and needs of stakeholders for a new or modified software product. It serves as the foundational blueprint for the entire project, ensuring that the final product aligns with user needs and business objectives. A thorough and well-executed Requirement Analysis phase is paramount to a project's success, directly impacting its timeline, budget, and overall quality.</p>

# Understanding the Core of Requirement Analysis

At its heart, Requirement Analysis is a process of discovery and communication. It seeks to answer fundamental questions such as:

> - What is the problem the software is intended to solve?
> - Who are the users, and what are their goals?
> - What functionalities must the software possess?
> - What are the performance, security, and usability expectations?
> - What are the constraints and limitations of the project?

To answer these questions, the process is typically broken down into several key activities:

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1.  **Elicitation**: This is the initial step of gathering requirements from all relevant stakeholders, including customers, users, business managers, and technical staff. Common techniques for elicitation include interviews, surveys, workshops, brainstorming sessions, and analysis of existing systems and documents.

2.  **Analysis**: Once gathered, the raw requirements are analyzed for clarity, completeness, consistency, and feasibility. Analysts identify and resolve any conflicts or ambiguities in the stated needs. This stage often involves prioritizing requirements based on business value and technical complexity.

3.  **Modeling**: To better understand and communicate the requirements, analysts often create visual models. These can include diagrams such as Use Case diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, which help to illustrate the system's behavior, data flows, and structure.

4.  **Specification**: The analyzed and modeled requirements are then formally documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. This document serves as a single source of truth for all stakeholders, detailing both functional and non-functional requirements.
    -   **Functional Requirements** describe what the system should *do*. For example:
        > `The system shall allow users to register for an account.`
    -   **Non-Functional Requirements** define the *qualities* of the system. For example:
        > -   **Performance:** `The system shall load the dashboard within 2 seconds.`
        > -   **Security:** `All user data must be encrypted.`
        > -   **Usability:** `The user interface should be intuitive for a novice user.`

5.  **Validation and Verification**: Before moving to the design phase, the documented requirements are reviewed and validated by the stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs. Verification ensures that the requirements are well-formed, complete, and consistent.
